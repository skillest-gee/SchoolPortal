## Database Constraints

### Unique Constraints
- User.email
- StudentProfile.studentId
- LecturerProfile.staffId
- Course.code
- Enrollment(studentId, courseId)
- AcademicRecord(studentId, courseId, semester, academicYear)
- Submission(assignmentId, studentId)
- Account(provider, providerAccountId)
- Session.sessionToken
- VerificationToken(identifier, token)

### Foreign Key Constraints
- All foreign key relationships use `onDelete: Cascade` where appropriate
- User deletion cascades to all related profile and academic data

## Indexing Strategy

### Recommended Indexes
1. `User.email` - Primary lookup field
2. `StudentProfile.studentId` - Institution ID lookup
3. `LecturerProfile.staffId` - Institution ID lookup
4. `Course.code` - Course lookup
5. `Enrollment.studentId` - Student enrollment queries
6. `Enrollment.courseId` - Course enrollment queries
7. `AcademicRecord.studentId` - Student transcript queries
8. `Assignment.courseId` - Course assignment queries
9. `Submission.studentId` - Student submission queries
10. `Fee.studentId` - Student fee queries
11. `Announcement.targetAudience` - Filtered announcement queries

## Data Types

### String Fields
- IDs: `cuid()` for unique identifiers
- Email: Standard email format
- Names: Human-readable text
- Codes: Institution-specific formats

### DateTime Fields
- All timestamps use `DateTime` type
- `@default(now())` for creation timestamps
- `@updatedAt` for automatic update tracking

### Decimal Fields
- Fee amounts: `Decimal(10, 2)` for precise financial calculations

### Enum Fields
- All status and type fields use appropriate enums
- Provides type safety and consistent data

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs
- No plain text password storage

### Data Privacy
- Sensitive information (addresses, phone numbers) are optional
- Email verification required for account activation

### Access Control
- Role-based access control through User.role
- Profile data separated by user type

## Migration Strategy

### Initial Setup
1. Run `prisma generate` to create client
2. Run `prisma db push` to create tables
3. Run `prisma db seed` to populate sample data

### Schema Changes
1. Modify schema.prisma
2. Run `prisma db push` for development
3. Create migration with `prisma migrate dev` for production

## Sample Data

The seed file includes:
- 1 Admin user
- 2 Lecturer users with profiles
- 3 Student users with profiles
- 3 Courses
- 5 Enrollments
- 1 Academic record
- 2 Assignments
- 1 Submission
- 2 Fees (1 paid, 1 unpaid)
- 2 Announcements

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Use `include` and `select` to limit data fetching
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use database indexes for frequently queried fields

### Caching Strategy
- Cache user profiles and course information
- Implement Redis for session management
- Use React Query for client-side caching

## Backup and Recovery

### Regular Backups
- Daily automated backups of production database
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Test restore procedures regularly

### Data Export
- Export capabilities for academic records
- GDPR compliance for data deletion
- Audit trail for sensitive operations
