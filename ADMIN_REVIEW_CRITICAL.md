## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **Permission Granularity - SECURITY RISK** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**Current State**: All-or-nothing admin access

**Issues**:
- ❌ Single "ADMIN" role - no sub-permissions
- ❌ Can't differentiate between:
  - IT Admin (system settings)
  - Academic Admin (applications, courses)
  - Financial Admin (fees, payments)
  - HR Admin (user management)
- ❌ Any admin can:
  - Delete users
  - Modify system settings
  - Approve payments
  - Change financial data
- ❌ No audit trail integration (we created it but it's not used)

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Security vulnerability

**Real-World Example**:
```
Scenario: IT admin accidentally deletes all student records
Impact: Catastrophic data loss
Cause: No permission separation
```

**Required Fix**:
```typescript
// Implement granular permissions
enum AdminPermission {
  USER_MANAGE = 'user.manage',
  USER_DELETE = 'user.delete',
  APPLICATION_APPROVE = 'application.approve',
  FINANCE_VIEW = 'finance.view',
  FINANCE_MODIFY = 'finance.modify',
  SETTINGS_MODIFY = 'settings.modify',
  SYSTEM_ADMIN = 'system.admin'
}

interface AdminProfile {
  permissions: AdminPermission[]
}
```

---

### 2. **Missing Activity Logging Integration** ⚠️⚠️

**Current State**: Audit logging system created but not used

**Issues**:
- ❌ No logs when admin:
  - Creates/deletes users
  - Approves/rejects applications
  - Modifies fees
  - Changes system settings
- ❌ Cannot audit:
  - Who did what
  - When changes were made
  - IP addresses
  - Changed values

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Compliance issue for real university

**Required Fix**:
```typescript
// Add to all admin operations
await logUserAction(
  session.user.id,
  'DELETE_USER',
  'User',
  userId,
  { deletedUser: user.email },
  request
)
```

---

### 3. **No Admin Approval Workflow** ⚠️⚠️

**Current State**: Single admin makes all decisions

**Issues**:
- ❌ Application approval: 1 admin decides (no validation)
- ❌ Fee changes: No approval chain
- ❌ User deletion: No confirmation workflow
- ❌ System settings: No audit before changes

**Impact**: **MEDIUM** - Accountability issue

**Real-World Example**:
```
Scenario: Admin approves invalid application
Impact: Student wrongly admitted
Cause: No peer review required
```

---

### 4. **Limited Reporting & Analytics** ⚠️

**Current State**: Basic statistics on dashboard

**Missing**:
- ❌ Academic performance reports
- ❌ Financial reports (detailed)
- ❌ Enrollment trends
- ❌ Graduation rates
- ❌ Fee collection reports
- ❌ Export functionality (PDF/Excel)
- ❌ Custom report builder

**Impact**: **MEDIUM** - Decision-making hampered

---

### 5. **No User Import/Export** ⚠️

**Current State**: Manual user creation only

**Missing**:
- ❌ Bulk user import (CSV/Excel)
- ❌ User data export
- ❌ Template downloads
- ❌ Import validation
- ❌ Error reporting for imports

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Scalability issue

---

### 6. **Fee Management Limitations** ⚠️⚠️

**Current State**: Manual fee creation and approval

**Issues**:
- ❌ No fee templates
- ❌ Can't duplicate fees
- ❌ No bulk fee operations
- ❌ Fee approval workflow missing
- ❌ No fee schedule management
- ❌ Payment approval too simplistic

**Impact**: **MEDIUM** - Efficiency issue

---

### 7. **Dashboard Limitations** ⚠️

**Missing**:
- ❌ Real-time system health monitoring
- ❌ Charts and graphs
- ❌ Trend analysis

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Data safety risk

---

### 10. **Course Management Gaps** ⚠️

**Missing**:
- ❌ Prerequisites management
- ❌ Course scheduling conflicts
- ❌ Room booking integration
- ❌ Capacity management
- ❌ Waitlist for full courses
- ❌ Course catalog versioning
