## 🔍 Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths
- Solid architecture (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma)
- Comprehensive database schema
- Core academic features working
- Good UI/UX with Tailwind CSS

2. **Email Service**: Fixed - now working with Resend
3. **Session Security**: Fixed - reduced to 4 hours
4. **Database Performance**: Fixed - added indexes
5. **Password Policy**: Already enforced

### 🚧 Remaining Issues
1. **Password Reset**: Not implemented
2. **S3 Storage**: Partial implementation
3. **API Pagination**: Missing in several endpoints
4. **Audit Logging**: Not implemented

## 📊 Production Readiness

### Current Status: **~70% Ready**

**Completed**:
- ✅ Email service working
- ✅ Security improvements
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Password policy enforced

**Pending** (Assignment-level acceptable):
- ⚠️ Password reset functionality
- ⚠️ Complete S3 migration
- ⚠️ API pagination
- ⚠️ Audit logging

---

## 💡 Payment System Note

**Important**: The payment system now uses a **MANUAL PROCESS** where:
- Students upload proof of payment (receipt/picture)
- Admin reviews and approves manually
- This is acceptable for an **assignment/project**

**For Production**:
- Would need payment gateway integration (Paystack/Stripe/Flutterwave)
- Estimated time: 2-3 days
- Not required for assignment scope
