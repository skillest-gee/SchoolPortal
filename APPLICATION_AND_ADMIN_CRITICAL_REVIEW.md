## ✅ EMAIL CONFIRMATION

### **Acceptance Letter Email** ✅

**Question**: Will the acceptance letter be sent to the email provided by the student?

**Answer**: ✅ **YES, CONFIRMED**

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// Line 318 in src/app/api/applications/[id]/route.ts
const admissionEmail = generateAdmissionEmail({
  studentName: `${application.firstName} ${application.lastName}`,
  email: application.email,  // ✅ Uses email from application form
  studentId: generatedStudentId,
  programme: application.programme.name,
  fees: fees,
  // ...
})

const emailResult = await sendEmail(admissionEmail)
console.log(`📧 Admission email sent successfully to ${application.email}`)
```

**Flow**:
1. Student fills application form with email
2. Email is stored in `application.email`
3. When admin approves, email is sent to `application.email`
4. Same email is used to create user account
5. All future communications use this email

if (fees) {
  const admissionEmail = generateAdmissionEmail({...})
  const emailResult = await sendEmail(admissionEmail)
}

// Second email send (lines 356-388) - DUPLICATE!
try {
  const admissionEmail = generateAdmissionEmail({...})
  const emailResult = await sendEmail(admissionEmail)
}
```
