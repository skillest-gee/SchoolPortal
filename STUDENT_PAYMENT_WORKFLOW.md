### **Step 6: Student Records Payment** 💵

**Since we're NOT using a payment gateway**, the workflow is:

3. Student fills in:
   - Payment amount
   - Payment method (Bank Transfer, Mobile Money, Cash, etc.)
   - **Reference number** (from bank/mobile money receipt)
   - Notes (optional)
4. Student submits
5. System records payment
6. **Admin verifies and approves**

#### **Option B: Upload Payment Receipt (Better)** ⚠️ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

1. Student clicks "Make Payment"
2. Student uploads payment receipt/confirmation
3. Admin receives notification
4. Admin verifies receipt
5. Admin approves payment

## 🎓 For Your Presentation

### **What to Say**:

"Students can view all their fees in the portal and record payments manually. Here's how it works:

1. When admin approves an application, fees are automatically created
2. Student receives email with fee breakdown
3. Student logs in and views fees in the finance page
4. Student records payment after making offline payment
5. Admin verifies and approves
6. System tracks payment status

**For a real university**, we'd integrate a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal for automatic processing."
